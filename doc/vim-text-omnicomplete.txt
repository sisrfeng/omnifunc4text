INTRODUCTION                                     *vim-text-omnicomplete-intro*

vim-text-omnicomplete is a Vim autocomplete plugin for English words in plain
text files. It provides autocomplete suggestions of English words based on a
word frequency list. To improve the accuracy of suggestions, it also makes
suggestions based on the preceding word.

This plugin automatically sets the omni completion function (|omnifunc|) for
files with the text filetype. As such, when editing text files, you will
be able to use |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O| to show a list of autocomplete suggestions.

The plugin works by first looking for a preceding word. If a previous word
is found, the plugin will look for probable next words from a bigram list.
To illustrate, suppose the user has so far typed "African co". If the bigram
list contains "african continent", "african countries", and "african country",
the plugin determines that "continent", "countries", and "country" are the
probable next words, and so it places these words into the list of suggestions.

When no next word can be found using the bigram method described above, or if
the bigram method does not return enough results, additional completions are
suggested from a list of words ordered by frequency. For example, if the user
has so far entered "enli", and the word frequency list contains
"enlightenment", "enlisted", and "enlightened", those words will be placed in
the list of suggestions.

USAGE                                           *vim-text-omnicomplete-usage*

This plugin automatically sets the omni completion function (|omnifunc|) to
`text_omnicomplete#Complete` for files with the text filetype. As such, when
editing text files, you will be able to use |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O| to show a list
of autocomplete suggestions.

You may also configure Vim to use `text_omnicomplete#Complete` for other
filetypes. For example, to use vim-text-omnicomplete for markdown files, add
this line to your |vimrc|: >

    autocmd FileType markdown setlocal omnifunc=text_omnicomplete#Complete
<

CONFIGURATION                                   *vim-text-omnicomplete-config*

vim-text-omnicomplete's behaviour can be configured by setting the global
variables below in your |vimrc| file and restarting Vim.

CONFIGURATION OPTIONS                          *vim-text-omnicomplete-options*

g:text_omnicomplete_enable_plugin          *g:text_omnicomplete_enable_plugin*
        Determines whether or not the plugin should be automatically loaded.
        If `1`, the plugin is automatically loaded for files with the text
        filetype. If `0`, the plugin is not automatically loaded. The default
        value is `1`.

g:text_omnicomplete_max_bigram_results *g:text_omnicomplete_max_bigram_results*
        The maximum number of suggestions, based on the previous word, to
        return. The default value is `300`.
        We recommend that you leave this option at its default value unless
        autocomplete is too slow, in which case you should set a lower value.

g:text_omnicomplete_max_total_results  *g:text_omnicomplete_max_total_results*
        The maximum number of suggestions to return.
        For example, if `g:text_omnicomplete_max_total_results` is `1000`, and
        `g:text_omnicomplete_max_bigram_results` is `200`, at most `200`
        results based on the previous word will be returned, and at most `800`
        of other results will be returned. The default value is `600`.
        We recommend that you leave this option at its default value unless
        autocomplete is too slow, in which case you should set a lower value.

g:text_omnicomplete_bigram_indicator    *g:text_omnicomplete_bigram_indicator*
        The indicator string used to identify bigram completion candidates
        in the popup completion menu. The default is an asterisk ('*').
        This can also be set to an empty string or a string with more than
        one character.

COMMANDS                                      *vim-text-omnicomplete-commands*

:TextOmnicompleteBuild                                *:TextOmnicompleteBuild*
Convenience command for running the build step. This can be run if you have
forgotten to run the build step during installation. It is safe to run this
command more than once.
