# vim-text-omnicomplete
`vim-text-omnicomplete` is a Vim autocomplete plugin for English words in plain
text files. It provides autocomplete suggestions of English words based on a
word frequency list. To improve the accuracy of suggestions, it also makes
suggestions based on the preceding word.

This plugin automatically sets the omni completion function (`omnifunc`) for
files with the text filetype. As such, when editing text files, you will
be able to use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>x</kbd><kbd>Ctrl</kbd><kbd>o</kbd> to show
a list of autocomplete suggestions.
