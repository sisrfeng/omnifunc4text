# vim-text-omnicomplete

`vim-text-omnicomplete` is a Vim autocomplete plugin for English words in plain text files.
It provides autocomplete suggestions of English words based on
a word frequency list.
To improve the accuracy of suggestions,
it also makes suggestions based on
the preceding word.


This plugin automatically sets the omni completion function
(`omnifunc`)
for files with the text filetype.
As such,
when editing text files,
you will be able to use <C-x>  <C-o> to show a list of autocomplete suggestions.
